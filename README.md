SOEN 287 Final Project - Simple PHP Storefront

Working version can be accessed here: https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~j_itt/EX-4/index.php

## About
This website was created as part of the final project for SOEN 287 at Concordia University. I understand that the layout of the website is a bit outdated; however, it followed the requirements requested by the professors for the class. The main goal of the project was to develop a simple storefront that allows the saving of (unencrypted) user data, which can then be used to login to the website and 'make purchases'. Sessions are used to crudely track what is placed in the user's cart. No actions are performed when attempting to checkout as this was not required in the project.

*NOTE: It will not work well on mobile devices. The website does **not** implement responsive design principles, as this was not a requirement of the course.*
